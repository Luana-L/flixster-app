# Project 3 - *Flixster Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **Luana Liao**

**Flixster Pt. 2** is an app that introduces networking by accessing data from the Movie Database API to show data about some of the recent popular movies.

Time spent: **3.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Implement network call and table view to display a list of movies currently playing (title, description, image)
- [x] App has a collection view with the same list of movies
- [x] Uses a tab bar controller to switch between collection view and table view screens
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Make an additional network call to another end-point.	
- [x] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! 
    - I changed the accent color so that the red items on the tab bar would better match the color scheme of my app!

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had some difficulties figuring out how to do the segue again since I didn't realize it was done the same way with the collection view as the table view, but once I figured that it, it was relatively easy!
